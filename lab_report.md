Lab Report: Web Application with Auth0 Integration
Name: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Project Title: [Your Project Title, e.g., "User Management and Content Access Web Application"]

1. Objective
To develop a web application that allows secure user registration, login, and content management using Auth0 for authentication.
Implement frontend and backend functionalities for managing users, controlling access to various features, and ensuring data security.
Achieve seamless integration of authorization and authentication to enhance user experience and data security.
2. Tools and Technologies
Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: For handling in-app navigation.
SCSS: CSS preprocessor for styling.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
Backend:

Node.js & Express.js: For setting up the server and handling API requests.
Auth0: Third-party service for managing user authentication and authorization.
MySQL: Database for storing user information.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure token-based authentication.
Others:

Yarn: Package manager for handling project dependencies.
Postman: For testing API endpoints.
3. System Architecture
The application is structured into two main components:

Frontend: Handles the user interface, interaction, and display logic.
Backend: Manages data processing, authentication logic, and database interactions.
Both components communicate over HTTP, with the frontend making API calls to the backend to retrieve or store data as required.

4. Frontend Design
Structure: The frontend is structured using a component-based architecture in React, allowing modularity and reuse.
Routing: Implemented with React Router to manage navigation between pages such as the login screen, user dashboard, and content pages.
Styling: SCSS is used to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
Auth0 Integration:
Auth0 Login/Logout: Users are redirected to Auth0 for login, and upon successful authentication, are redirected back with an access token.
Profile Page: The access token is used to display personalized user data from Auth0 on the profile page.
Axios: Axios is used for making API calls to the backend for fetching or updating user data.
5. Backend Design
Authentication and Authorization:
JWT Tokens: The backend verifies the JWT tokens issued by Auth0 to confirm user identity and access rights.
Protected Routes: Implemented middleware in Express to check for a valid JWT token on routes that require authentication.
Database Integration:
MySQL Database: Stores essential user data, such as email addresses, in a secure manner.
User Data Storage: Only essential information (e.g., email) is stored to ensure compliance with data protection principles.
API Endpoints:
/api/auth/login: Validates login requests.
/api/auth/logout: Clears user session.
/api/users: Retrieves or modifies user data (restricted to admins).
/api/content: Returns data related to public or user-specific content.
6. Auth0 Configuration and Token Management
Auth0 Setup: Configured an Auth0 application with specific settings to manage user authentication. Callback URLs and allowed origins were configured to ensure secure communication.
Token Validation:
JWT Validation: Implemented middleware to decode and verify JWTs in backend routes.
Error Handling: Specific error messages are generated if the JWT is invalid or expired, prompting users to re-login.
7. Testing and Debugging
Frontend Testing:

Manual Testing: Each page and interaction was manually tested in the browser to ensure UI elements and Auth0 authentication flow function as expected.
Postman: Tested API requests and responses to verify the integrity of data exchange between frontend and backend.
Backend Testing:

JWT.io: Used JWT.io to decode and verify tokens received from Auth0 during the testing phase.
Console Logs: Extensively used console logging for tracking data flow and identifying errors.
Error Handling: Implemented error messages to handle cases where token validation fails or users attempt unauthorized access.
8. Challenges and Solutions
Token Validation Issue: Encountered a problem where tokens were not validated properly due to token format issues. Resolved by ensuring compatibility with RS256 signing algorithm.
CORS Errors: Faced CORS issues during development, which were addressed by configuring CORS middleware in Express to accept requests from the frontend.
Auth0 Permissions: Configured permissions in Auth0 to handle various user roles, ensuring only authorized users could access specific API routes.
9. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates a secure, user-friendly web application with role-based access control, using Auth0 for authentication. The frontend and backend communicate efficiently, providing a responsive and secure experience. This approach can be extended for larger applications that require robust authentication and user management.

10. Future Improvements
Add Role Management: Implement different user roles (e.g., admin, editor) with specific permissions.
Enhanced UI/UX: Introduce more interactive and visually appealing components on the frontend.
Automated Testing: Integrate automated tests for both frontend and backend to streamline future development.
